Every message is executed freshly.

You can write _multiline code in one message_ 😊.
->Tab is 4 spaces
-> Newline is a newline in the same message body

If a message has only one line it is passed to eval and the returned value is given back to you.
That means you can just write 4*4 and no need of print(4*4) in a single line message.

If you are writing a multiline message, you must use the print statement to print something.
