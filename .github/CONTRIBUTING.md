Read and follow the contributing guidelines given below and [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the project.

Before you start writing code to contribute to this project, please **discuss** the changes you want to make, with me.

It will help us to understand the changes better.

## How to Discuss

To discuss any changes you want to make, please create an **issue** with a proper title. Choose from the templates: Bug Report, Feature Request or create a custom issue. Also include the statement that you wish to contribute code for the issue.

After the issue has been created, wait for the maintainers to assign the issue to you.

You can also chat with me on [Telegram](https://t.me/AahnikDaw).

If the Telegram link does not work, search `@AahnikDaw` in the telegram app to chat with me.

## Steps to Follow

- After the issue has been **assigned to you**, start working on the planned changes by forking the project.

- Please create a new **separate branch** for each issue that you're working on.

- *Do not make changes to any of the existing branches.* Please work only on the newly created separate branch.

- You must attribute your work to the same license as the project, and allow me the right to publish the work under this project. Your name will appear permanently in the list of contributors.

- Write comprehensive and robust tests that cover the changes you've made in your work.

- Follow the appropriate code style standards for the language and framework you're using (like  PEP 8 for Python).

- Write readable code â€“ keep functions small and modular and name variables descriptively.

- Document your code thoroughly.

- Make sure all the existing tests pass.
