*Every message is executed freshly as python code*. Suppose you define a variable in one message, you won't be able to access it in the next message.

But you can write _multiline code in one message_
->Tab is 4 spaces
-> Newline is a newline in the same message body

To evaluate a pythonic expression, use /e `4 >= 5`

If I am being used by too many people, there may be a delay in response as I am deployed on a free tier server.

Note: 😁 Sometimes I behave quite differently from a regular python interactive shell. Certain things are not allowed to prevent horrible consequences.

To get source code send /code.
